# Code
The core of the code for HP-MIA (PyTorch implementation).

This repository provides the functions for calculating the membership scores (`Compute_score.py`) as well as the architecture of the neural network models used for testing (`models.py`).

Please refer to `requirements.txt` to configure the environment.

This implementation references codes from [ml-leaks-pytorch](https://github.com/GeorgeTzannetos/ml-leaks-pytorch), 
[membership-inference-evaluation](https://github.com/inspire-group/membership-inference-evaluation) and [Purchase100 and Texas100 dataset](https://github.com/xehartnort/Purchase100-Texas100-datasets). Thank the authors for their excellent work !
